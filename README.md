# Hexa Sort

**Hexa Sort** is a relaxing and colorful mobile puzzle game where players drag hexagonal blocks onto a grid to match and clear them. It blends strategic placement with satisfying visuals and simple controls, making it easy to learn but challenging to master.

This project is a hobby recreation inspired by the original *Hexa Sort* game by Gamebrain, created for learning purposes and portfolio development.
